# SQL-Query
In a SQL module, I was tasked with designing a range of queries to interact with a table of customers. The table contained information such as customer names, addresses, and purchase history. I used SQL commands to create and manipulate the table, and then wrote a series of queries to extract and analyze the data.

Some of the queries I wrote included:

Selecting all customers who lived in a specific city
Counting the number of customers who had made a purchase in the last month
Retrieving the total amount spent by each customer
Joining the customer table with other tables to get more information about the customer's purchase history
Creating a report showing the top-selling products for a certain period of time.
I also used aggregate functions such as SUM, COUNT and AVG to perform calculations on the data, and used clauses like WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING to filter and organize the information.

The module helped me to improve my SQL skills and understanding of how to extract and analyze data from a database.
